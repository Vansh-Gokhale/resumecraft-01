Technologies Used 🛠️
Frontend:

Framework/Library: React

Build Tool: Vite

Language: TypeScript

UI Components: shadcn/ui

Styling: Tailwind CSS

Routing: React Router DOM

State Management/Data Fetching: TanStack Query (React Query)

API Client: Axios

Authentication: Firebase Client SDK

Backend:

Framework: Express.js

Language: TypeScript

Runtime: Node.js

Authentication: Firebase Admin SDK (for token verification)

AI: Google Generative AI SDK (@google/generative-ai)

Database: Firebase Firestore (for storing user data, resume metadata, generated content, etc.)

File Handling: Multer (uploads), Mammoth (docx parsing), pdf-parse (pdf parsing)

API Testing: Jest, Supertest (setup, actual tests might be pending)

Project Structure 🗂️
The project is organized into two main parts:

frontend (root directory): Contains the React application built with Vite.

src/: Main source code.

components/: Reusable UI components (including shadcn/ui).

pages/: Top-level page components for different routes.

lib/: Core utilities like API client (api.ts), Firebase setup (firebase.ts).

context/: React context providers (e.g., AuthContext.tsx).

App.tsx: Main application component defining routes.

main.tsx: Application entry point.

backend/: Contains the Node.js/Express API server.

src/: Main source code.

controllers/: Request handlers containing business logic.

routes/: Defines API endpoints and maps them to controllers.

middleware/: Custom middleware (e.g., auth.middleware.ts for token verification).

config/: Configuration files (e.g., multer.config.ts, Firebase Admin setup).

models/: Contains data models/schemas (e.g., for User, Resume, JobMatchResult) likely interacting with the database.

server.ts: Express application setup and entry point.

Models and Database 📈
Models: The backend/src/models/ directory likely defines the structure of data used in the application, such as User profiles, Resume details (metadata, parsed content, analysis results), and potentially Job descriptions or Match results. These models interface with the database.

Database: Firebase Firestore is used as the NoSQL database. It stores user account information, links to uploaded resumes (stored possibly in Firebase Storage or locally), parsed resume content, analysis scores, generated resume data, and job matching results.

User Workflow 📊
A typical user interaction with AI Career Forge follows these steps:

Authentication: * New users sign up for an account. * Existing users log in.

**Resume Management (Choose one or more): * Upload & Analyze: Upload an existing resume (PDF/DOCX). The system parses it and provides AI-driven analysis and scoring. * Build: Use the Resume Builder feature to create a new resume from scratch or based on provided information.

Job Matching: * Provide a job description. * Select an uploaded or generated resume. * The system analyzes the match between the resume and the job description, providing insights.

Review & Refine: * Based on analysis and matching results, users can refine their resumes using the builder or by uploading revised versions. * Access general resume tips for guidance.

(Optional) Cover Letter: Generate cover letters (feature implied by dashboard structure).

API Endpoints Overview 📚
The backend exposes RESTful API endpoints, primarily authenticated using Firebase ID tokens verified by the auth.middleware.ts.

Key route groups under /api:

/auth:

POST /signup: User registration.

POST /login: User login.

/resumes (Requires Authentication):

GET /: Get list of uploaded resumes for the authenticated user.

POST /upload: Upload a resume file (resumeFile) for parsing and storage.

POST /:resumeId/analyze: Trigger AI analysis for a specific uploaded resume.

/builder (Requires Authentication):

GET /generated: Get list of resumes generated by the builder for the user.

POST /generate: Generate a new resume based on user input.

GET /download/:generatedResumeId: Download a specific generated resume (likely as PDF).

/match (Requires Authentication):

POST /resume-job: Compare a user's resume (by ID or potentially text) against a provided job description.

/tips:

GET /: Fetch general resume writing tips.

(Refer to backend/src/routes/*.routes.ts and corresponding controllers in backend/src/controllers/ for detailed request/response structures and logic.)

Getting Started 🚀
Prerequisites
Node.js and npm (or yarn/pnpm/bun)

Firebase Project: Set up a Firebase project for Authentication and Firestore.

Google Cloud Project: Set up a project for Google Generative AI and enable the API.

Environment Variables: Create .env files in both the root (frontend) and backend directories.

Environment Variables
Root Directory (Frontend - .env):

Backend Directory (backend/.env):

Installation 🛠️
Clone the repository: bash git clone https://github.com/sushil930/ai-career-forge.git cd ai-career-forge

Install Frontend Dependencies: bash npm install # or yarn install, pnpm install, bun install

Install Backend Dependencies: bash cd backend npm install # or yarn install, pnpm install, bun install cd ..

Running the Project 🚀
Start the Backend Server: Open a terminal in the backend directory: bash cd backend npm run dev # or yarn dev, pnpm dev, bun dev The backend server will typically start on http://localhost:3000 (or the port specified in backend/.env).

Start the Frontend Development Server: Open another terminal in the root project directory: bash npm run dev # or yarn dev, pnpm dev, bun dev The frontend development server will typically start on http://localhost:5173.

Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:5173.

Building for Production 📦
Frontend:

From the root directory:

This will create a dist folder with the production-ready static assets.

Backend:

From the backend directory:

This will compile TypeScript to JavaScript, typically in a dist or build folder within the backend directory. You can then run the compiled code using node dist/server.js (or similar).
